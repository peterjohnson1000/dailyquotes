## Why?
Quotes are often regarded as condensed pieces of advice or wisdom. They distill complex ideas, experiences, or insights into brief, memorable phrases that can inspire, inform, or provoke thought. 
And I love reading them so I though why not make an app that just does that.

## Requirement
The main requirements that I had in mind was:
- Super simple interface.
- Users should be able to select from a predefined set of categories.
- A minimalist widget that clearly displays a quote along with the author name and updates every day.

## Widget Screen
Every day at 12:00 AM the app automaticaly picks a new quote from the category that the user has selected
